# Task: Implement AI Disease Detection Chat using Gemini

## ðŸ“Œ **Overview**
We are building an AI-powered chat where users describe their health symptoms and receive possible causes, severity assessment, and recommendations. This functionality will use **Gemini**, which will process user input and generate structured responses in JSON format for easy parsing and display in the app.

This feature is aimed at helping users understand possible medical conditions based on their symptoms and advising them when they need to seek medical attention.

---

## âœ… **Input Details**

The input to Gemini will be plain text from the user describing their symptoms. The input may vary widely, such as:

- **Short phrases or keywords:**  
  `"fever"`  
  `"headache and nausea"`  
  `"stomach pain"`

- **Detailed sentences:**  
  `"I have been having a sore throat and mild fever for the last few days."`  
  `"My joints are aching and I feel very tired all the time."`  
  `"I have chest pain when I breathe deeply and also feel short of breath."`

The AI must handle both cases â€” whether the user gives a few words or a detailed description â€” and interpret them accurately to suggest possible causes, severity, and recommendations.

## âœ… **Instructions for Gemini**

You are an empathetic and accurate medical assistant AI. When given the userâ€™s symptoms in text, you should:

1. **Interpret the symptoms**, even if the description is brief or incomplete.
2. **Identify probable causes** related to the symptoms.
3. **Determine the severity level**, categorizing it as `"mild"`, `"moderate"`, or `"severe"`.
4. **Provide practical recommendations** on what the user should do next, such as monitoring symptoms or consulting a doctor.
5. **Include a disclaimer** stating that the information is not a replacement for professional medical advice.

Your output must always be in **JSON format** exactly as specified below.

---

## âœ… **Input Handling Notes**

- If the user provides only one or two symptoms (e.g., `"fever"`), infer likely causes related to common illnesses.
- If the symptoms are serious (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing), categorize them as `"severe"` and advise immediate medical consultation.
- If the symptoms are mild and common (e.g., sore throat, headache), categorize them as `"mild"` and advise monitoring and rest.
- Do not ask follow-up questions; only process the symptoms given.
